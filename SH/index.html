                         <p> Advertising is ubiquitous on the Internet, it funds a large amount of free content on the web. However, targeted advertising has become one of the most insidious and privacy invasive tactics, as tracking users has become commonplace. The online advertising industry is secrative and lacks transparency on the methods used to tailor adverts to a user, these are the main motivation for this research. Along with the plugin produced, a centralised report has been compiled, with the intention for this to form the basis of an article which may be proposed to relevant journals, to bring these practices to the forefront of user attention. </p>

                         <p> The plugin was created as part of my CS4099 Senior Honours Project. In conjunction with an industry expert, the plugin can be used to replace the image of an advert with its id and src attributes. This poses several advantages for those working in the advertising field by vastly reducing the time requried from them to open up their browsers development tools and search for an IFrame object to find out where it is coming from. The plugin explores the IFrame source in a visual manner with little installation necessary for a user. Along with the benefits for those in the industry, it could be used by an eager everyday user to indentify where these adverts are coming from and in conjunction who is tracking them for advertising purposes. This webpage includes a Testing section in which I have simulated an online news article, which frequently contain numerous adverts, the purpose of this testbed is to show the potential of the plugin in a controlled environment simulation. </p>

                                <h2> HMRC paid Facebook £27,000 last year for adverts advising people how and when to pay their taxes </h2>

                                <img class="module-image" src="assets/images/Facebook.jpg">

                                <p> HMRC pays Facebook six times the amount the company pays in tax to buy adverts telling people to pay their taxes, it has been reported. While Facebook paid £4,327 in tax in 2014, a Freedom of Information request by Channel 4 News revealed the company was paid £27,000 by HMRC the following year.</p>

                                <br>   

                                <p>  
                                 The money paid for adverts advising people how and when to pay their taxes. Facebook's tax bill is actually lower than that of the average worker. In 2014, the company paid its UK-based employees an average of £210,000 in pay and bonuses. It gave its London staff Facebook shares worth £35.4 million, pushing its losses to £28.5 million - hugely reducing its tax bill.  Many of its other profits from the UK are sent to its international headquarters in Ireland, which then puts them in the low-tax Cayman Islands. 
                                 <br>
                                 In 2013, Facebook paid no corporation tax at all. A spokesperson for HMRC told Channel 4 News: "Like all large organisations we find that an increasing number of those we serve communicate through and get their information from social media.
                                </p>  

                                <br> 

                                <p> 
                                  "Our investment in social media is carefully evaluated to ensure we are getting maximum value for the taxpayer." Facebook said: "We are compliant with UK tax law and in fact all countries where we have employees and offices." The social media giant has been accused of paying corporation tax rate of 3.6 per cent around the world in 2014, much lower than the 21 per cent corporation tax rate large companies have to pay in the UK. 
                                  <br>
                                  A number of huge Silicon Valley firms, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, have been accused of using complex arrangements to legally pay low rates of tax on profits generated in the UK.Google was forced to pay £130 million in back taxes dating back to 2005, which Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said meant the company had an effective tax rate of three per cent.
